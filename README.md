### What is PAPO?

The nature of the problem at hand revolves around the client's manual and time-consuming drug procurement processes, characterized by the need for constant evaluation of alternatives based on price, quantity, and packaging. Additionally, the criticality of specific drugs necessitates a precise and timely restocking strategy. Our final deliverable aims to address these challenges comprehensively through an AI-driven procurement solution. 

This solution comprises a three-tiered technical approach: continuous stock monitoring and replenishment based on live feed analysis, intelligent recommendations for alternative drug replacements drawn from the pharmacy's database, and the development of a user-friendly interface based on client feedback. The proposed model offers innovative features such as dynamic stock monitoring, intelligent alternative recommendations prioritized by cost, dosage preference, and packaging, and a user-centric interface tailored to streamline the buyer's decision-making process. This solution is poised to significantly optimize the client's drug procurement workflow, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness to critical drug restocking requirements.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires `node.js & npm`, `react`, `next.js`, `python`, and `fastapi`, to be installed in your system. If you don&#39;t have it installed, you can follow these steps:

### For MacOS users: Use Homebrew

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"        



#### `node.js & npm`

- **Recommended Method: Using Homebrew** ***(for MacOS users)*** | Others OS can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install Yarn globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run:

  ```sh
  brew install node
  ```

    This command will install both **Node.js** and **npm** on your system.

- Verify that Node and npm has been installed on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

  ```sh
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```

  If  has been installed correctly, your terminal should display the version of Node and npm installed on your machine.

#### `react`

- Install React using the [official documentation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)

#### `next.js`

- Install Next.js using the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

#### `python`

- Install python using homebrew:

    ```sh
    brew install python
    ```

#### `fastapi`

- Open your terminal and run:
    
    ```sh
    pip install "fastapi[all]"
    ```

### Installation

Please follow the following steps for successful installation:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Get started by cloning the **[frontend](https://github.com/BU-EC463/frontend.git)** and **[backend](https://github.com/BU-EC463/API.git)** repositories to your local machine.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BU-EC463/frontend.git # [Front End Repository]
   git clone https://github.com/BU-EC463/API.git # [Back End Repository]
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Packages:** Navigate to the &quot;/frontend&quot; directory and install the required npm packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
   
3. **Install Backend Packages:** Similarly, navigate to the &quot;/API&quot; directory and install the required yarn packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   cd API
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment:**

   - In the &quot;API&quot; repository, copy the content of &quot;.env.example&quot; file and create a new file named &quot;.env&quot;. Adjust the environment variables according to your requirements or you can leave them as it is.

   - Navigate to &quot;frontend/.env.example&quot; and create a new file named &quot;.env&quot;. In the new .env set the BASE parameter to your backend API route. For instance, if you are running backend on your local server at port 8080, you should set:

     ```javascript
     BASE: "http://localhost:8080/api";
     ```

5. **Run the Backend:** Navigate to &quot;/backend&quot; directory and type the following command in your terminal to run your backend server:

   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend:** Finally, navigate to &quot;/frontend&quot; directory and type the following command in your terminal to run your frontend server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The server should be running on http://localhost:3000/

   Now, your application should be successfully up and running!
